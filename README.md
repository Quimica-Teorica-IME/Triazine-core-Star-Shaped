In this repository, you will find the singlet ground state (S0) geometries of in the neutral, cationic, and anionic states, also for the unsubstituted Triazine core.

S0 optimizations were carried out employing wb97xD/Def2-TZVP using the Gaussian09 program. By using the optimized geometries, ten vertical singlet excited states were computed using the wb97xD/Def2-TZVP. These data were also included.

It also contains two Excel file respectively with the Optoelectronic-and-photovoltaic-properties (Optoelectronic-and-photovoltaic-properties.xls) of the aforementioned systems.

All results of charge transfer analyzes were also included, such as CT parameters obtained through the TheoDore program (CHARGE TRANSFER ANALYSIS).

We hope our work will help you in any way possible and feel free to contact us.

From the Theoretical Chemistry Group at the Military Institute of Engineering (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), we wish you all the best.
